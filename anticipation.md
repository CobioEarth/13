## Index of Axioms

1. **001 – The Axiom of Anticipation**  
   *Essence*: Awareness is leverage. Act before the vector manifests.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/001.md`

2. **002 – The Axiom of Balance**  
   *Essence*: Equilibrium is an active stance between poles.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/002.md`

3. **003 – The Axiom of Recursion**  
   *Essence*: Completion is never terminal. Recursion governs continuity.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/003.md`

4. **004 – The Axiom of Procrastination (Reframed)**  
   *Essence*: Procrastination means act in favor of tomorrow. Minimum daily tending is the ethical floor.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/004.md`

5. **005 – The Gamified Ethic**  
   *Essence*: One daily act sustains. Surplus acts compound. Progress is a causal chain, not a leap.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/005.md`

## ASCII Lattice Schema

```

```
         (001) Anticipation
              /       \
             /         \
      (005)            (002)
 Gamified Ethic      Balance
          \           /
           \         /
      (004) Procrastination*
            \       /
             \     /
         (003) Recursion
```

* Procrastination = act in favor of tomorrow

```

**Reading the schema**  
- Top apex 001 primes all others.  
- 005 and 002 form the action–equilibrium corridor.  
- 004 is the daily floor that prevents collapse.  
- 003 closes the loop so the cycle never stalls.

## Structural Notes

- **Singular Node Rule**: Each axiom is a sovereign `.md` file.  
- **Index Function**: Navigation only. No content collapse.  
- **Pentad Seal**: Five nodes form a closed loop. Any traversal that touches all five is an affirmed cycle.

---

## Navigation Protocol

- **REFRAIN (–1)** → Skip node. Hold silence.  
- **TEND (0)** → Open one node. Commit one note. Close.  
- **AFFIRM (+1)** → Traverse full pentad. Produce a derivative artifact.
